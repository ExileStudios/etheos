# NPC Speech information
#
# Format:
#  id.frequency = speech attempt frequency (number)
#  id.chance = rate that the NPC will speak, expressed as a percentage
#  id.speech.x = phrase that the NPC can say
#
# Example:
#  7.frequency = 60s
#  7.chance = 90%
#  7.speech.1 = Beh
#  7.speech.2 = Behhhh
#  7.speech.3 = I'm a goat
#
# Every 60 seconds, NPC ID 7 will make an attempt to speak
# There is a 90% chance that the NPC will actually speak
# The NPC will randomly select between "Beh", "Behhhh", and "I'm a goat"
#
# Only one NPC that spawns per set of spawn coordinates will actually say anything
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
